# Consumer Rights and Unfair Contract Terms

## Automatic Renewal Clauses
Clauses that automatically renew a service or subscription without adequate notice to the consumer are often considered unfair. The consumer must be given a clear and timely reminder, as well as an easy way to cancel the contract. A contract that renews indefinitely without user action is highly suspect.

## Waiver of Rights
Any term that forces a consumer to waive their fundamental legal rights, such as the right to sue the company, participate in a class-action lawsuit, or report the company to a regulatory body, is generally unenforceable and considered an unfair practice.

## Hidden Fees and Charges
Contracts must be transparent about all costs. Clauses that allow a company to introduce new fees or significantly change existing ones without the consumer's explicit consent are deceptive. All potential charges should be clearly and conspicuously disclosed at the time of signing.
