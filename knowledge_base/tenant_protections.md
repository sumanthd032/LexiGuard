# Tenant and Renter Protections

## Unreasonable Landlord Access
While landlords have the right to enter a rental property for inspections and repairs, the lease must specify a reasonable notice period (typically 24 hours). A clause that allows the landlord to enter the property at any time without notice is an invasion of privacy and is often illegal.

## Unfair Forfeiture of Security Deposit
The conditions for withholding a security deposit must be clearly stated and limited to actual damages beyond normal wear and tear. A clause that allows a landlord to keep the entire deposit for minor rule infractions or as a non-refundable "fee" is typically considered a penalty and may be illegal.

## Landlord Negligence (Habitability)
A lease cannot waive the landlord's responsibility to maintain a safe and habitable living environment. This is known as the "implied warranty of habitability." Any clause that states the tenant is responsible for all repairs, including major structural or safety issues, is likely void.
